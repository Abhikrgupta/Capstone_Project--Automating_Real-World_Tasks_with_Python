Write a Python script

This is the challenge section of the lab where you'll write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:

    1. Iterate through each file in the folder
    2. For each file:
        a. Rotate the image 90Â° clockwise
        b. Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
        c. Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format

Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/

This is the first week lab of the Capstone Project: The lab named- Scale and convert images using PIL.

**Do not edit the file**
